## REDSHIFT 
Redshift is a spectral measurement of how far from the earth the galaxy is moving. The [sdss](https://www.sdss.org/) is a survey conducted by a telescope in the night sky that takes pictures of various regions in the sky. In this example, we present the preprocessing techniques for SDSS images as well as the code to the model presented by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06607). If you use this model, please cite the paper:

Since, the exported webgme project is quite large, you can download it from [here](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/umesh_timalsina_vanderbilt_edu/EZ0ME7hGyUlHqu6n1YmqrIsBdRmfQaKGB1yE7rpHAw5M-w?e=azaP34) and run the pipelines. There are three pipelines as shown in the screen-shot below:

The model designed in deepforge is as follows:
