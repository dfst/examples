# DeepForge Starter Kit
The deepforge starter kit provides the following example pipelines operations demonstrating various features of deepforge including:
- hello world example
- using operation attributes
- plotting operation results (in real time)
- displaying tensors as images
- operation references
- multi-threading

When viewing a pipeline, the details of any operation (with the exception of Input/Output operations) can be inspected by clicking on the operation and then selecting the code button (labeled with `</>`) in the top right.

Each pipeline can also be executed within deepforge using the play button option in the floating action button (floating button in the lower right). The play button is available after hovering on the button in the lower right.
